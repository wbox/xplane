# Flight Factor A350 Oil PSI

## Use at your own risk

This is a lua script that simulates the oil psi for Flight Factor A350.
Use this script at your own risk. I cannot provide any support or guarantee
that this script will not cause any damange on your computer, simulator, other
addons, scripts etc. 

Currently I'm using the N3 values from both engines as reference, so the PSI values
showing are for simulation proposes only and cannot be used to simulate panes or any other 
activity that simulates the real aircraft.

I'm still researching about the formulas that calculate these values properly, so if you the 
formulas, please open an issue to share the information or even to fix it.

## How to install

Copy the a350oilpsi.lua script to the FlyWithLua scripts folder
